FAQ

Q: Are these fonts owned by Konami?
A: No. Since these fonts are full recreations, vectorised versions of the original bitmaps, and include new glyphs, they are not owned by Konami. For example, the large "Peace Walker" font is an approximation, and does not contain anti-aliasing present in the original bitmap font.
