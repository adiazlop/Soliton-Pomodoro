# Overview

This is a personal project, as I'm an avid user of the Pomodoro Technique.The idea was to create a Pomodoro Timer tailored for my me and my girlfriend, while I practiced React and JavaScript. I hope you enjoy it.

Altough its a WIP, there are several milestones I'd like to achieve.

## Milestones

- Stardew Valley Skin
- Metal Gear Solid Codecs Skin (MGS1, 2, Ghost Babel)
- Other Skins (Castlevania, Policenauts, Death Stranding)
- Database of time inverted on the pomodoro timer.
- App Store packaging
- Animations, sounds, three.js integration.
