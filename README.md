This is a personal project, as I'm an avid user of the Pomodoro Technique.The idea was to create a Pomodoro Timer tailored for my me and my girlfriend, while I practiced React and JavaScript. I hope you enjoy it.

Altough its a WIP, there are several milestones I'd like to achieve.

## Milestones

- ✅ Add full cicle (25 min, 5 min break)
- Change Character Icons (Holly, Fox, Campbell, etc) 
- Dialogues and text pop up
- Animations, sounds and music integration.
- Gamification (Each cicle you earn an item for the game)
- Metal Gear Solid Codecs Skin (MGS1, 2, Ghost Babel)
- Database of time inverted on the pomodoro timer.
- App Store packaging for Android, Linux and Windows using Tauri or Electron.
